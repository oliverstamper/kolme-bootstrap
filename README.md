## Description

The third challenge culminated of building another portfolio, incorporating bootstrap. Besides the obvious motivation of completing the activity to get graded, I took extra care in this project as it will serve as an illustration to potential employers and clients of my programming ability and evidence of past projects. Given many contained links to websites it could also be used by these parties to get a reference. The lesson it taught me in using bootstrap will be invaluable in the future, given the amount of time bootstrap can save in formating and providing templates
